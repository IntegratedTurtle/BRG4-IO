# Topics
## Fundamentals
    - Recursion
    - Big-O Notation
    - In/Output
    - Pointer
    - Datastructures (e.g. set, map, unordered_map, etc.)

## "Basic" Techniques
    - Recursion Problems (Towers of Harnoi) IMPORTANT
    - Dynamic Programming (Knapsack Problem, Origami, Levenshtein Distance etc.) IMPORTANT
    - Simple Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra, BFS, DFS)
    - Simple Tree Problems (Min-Spanning Tree)
    - Bit operations and Bitsets

## "Advanced" Stuff
    - More Advanced Graph Algorithms and Problems
    - Segtrees (Lazy, Spare, Updates)
    - String Algorithms (Hashing etc.)
  


### "If we have too mucht time"
    - Trees (how to press them into a range to perform range queries)
    - Central Decomposition
